Motion-tracking and Face Detection [Link]
•	Developed a side-project utilizing OpenCV for face detection, motion sensing, and hand detection.
•	Implemented face detection algorithms to identify and track faces in real-time using a webcam.
•	Designed and programmed a motion sensor system to detect and respond to movement within a specified area.
•	Created hand-detection functionality to recognize and interpret hand gestures for interactive applications.
•	Utilized Python and OpenCV libraries to achieve accurate and efficient results.
